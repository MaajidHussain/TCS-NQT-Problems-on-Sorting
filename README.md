# TCS-NQT-Problems-on-Sorting
Here we're going to see multiple coding questions based on Sorting Algorithms which were asked frequently in TCS NQT.

1. Bubble Sort:-
                If we have a un-sorted array, when we iterate through our pass-1 in this iteration(pass) the first biggest element will be moved(positioned) towards the right corner in the Array.
After this second iteration will get's start and in this itertation our second pass will iterate through all the elements till the N-1 Elements and the second Largest Element will be placed in the Second right most Position.
.
.
.
Like this the iteration will be done until the given range and the List will get's sorted in the last iteration and all the elements will be placed according to their Ascending Order.
